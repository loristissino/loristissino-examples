ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY: A TALE

This is a demonstration of how asymmetric cryptography works.

Two people, Alice and Bob, want to send messages each other without
sharing a common secret.

So, they both choose a private key and generate a public key from that,
sharing only the latter. How can this work?

Imagine that Alice and Bob choose a common prime number, that they both
know. Here, suppose they chose Y=30983.

They also choose a number to be used for modulus computation. Here,
suppose they chose P=40993.

Alice chooses her own private key as 1087.

She computes her public key as (30983 ^ 1087) % 40993 = 1771, 
and then sends it to Bob.

On the other side, Bob computes his public key 
as (30983 ^ 2083) % 40993 = 26537, and sends it to Alice.

Now, Alice has her own private key (1087) and Bob's public key (26537).
Since she wants to send her message, she first computes a session key
using her own private key and Bob's public key, like here:

The session key is computed as (26537 ^ 1087) % 40993.
Its value is 7225.

With this session key, Alice can encrypt a message with a symmetric key
program.

When Bob receives the file, he computes the session key using his own
private key and Alice's public key, much like Alice did herself.

The session key is computed as (1771 ^ 2083) % 40993,
which is exactly the same Alice has used: 7225.
