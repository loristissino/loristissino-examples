# TmcMsg

This is a very basic introductory example of a couple of classes that deal with
sending and receiving messages through a HTTP connection to a web server that 
offers this kind of service.

In the examples, one can see:

- how to use the HttpClient to make Get and Post requests;
- how to deal with asynchronous methods and the `await` keyword;
- how to manage the status code returned by the web server;
- how to use the `Authorization: Bearer` HTTP header.
