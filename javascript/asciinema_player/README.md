# Asciinema Player, with audio

[Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) is a lightweight, purely text-based
approach to terminal recording.

It records what you type in your terminal and the output of your commands.
Everything is stored in JSON format.

If you record your voice to comment what you are doing, it is possible
to play the audio file keeping it in sync with the video.

A basic version of the needed code is in the `index.html` file.

See the [official documentation](https://asciinema.org/docs/embedding)
for more information.
